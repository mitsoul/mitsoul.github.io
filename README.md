MIT SOUL (students for open and universal learning) is an organization that works to accelerate, experiment with, and build a stronger culture of open education at institutions of higher education, starting with MIT. We want to live in a world where anyone can learn anything from anywhere for free or at a low cost. To that end, our main goal in the short term is to open source learning materials from as many college courses as possible in a way that makes those courses “realistically learnable”.

## How to Help

In addition to working with professors to put up their courses, we are also making a curated directory of relatively "complete" MIT course materials that already exist online but can be otherwise hard to find. One easy and high-impact way to contribute is to add links to existing high-quality open course materials as a PR to [the courses/mit folder in this repo](https://github.com/mitsoul/mitsoul.github.io/tree/main/docs/courses/mit)! We will review your PR and try to incorporate the links into [mitsoul.org/courses](https://mitsoul.org/courses). 

We also have a number of open source video tooling in [our GitHub organization](https://github.com/mitsoul), which we invite people to help improve and resolve issues on. We also have a much broader [set of focus areas](https://mitsoul.org/projects/) for projects that we want to support, so definitely reach out to soul@mit.edu if you'd like to contribute.
