MIT SOUL (students for open and universal learning) is an organization that works to accelerate, experiment with, and build a stronger culture of open education at institutions of higher education, starting with MIT. We want to live in a world where anyone can learn anything from anywhere for free or at a low-cost. To that end, our main goal in the short term is to open source learning materials from as many college courses as possible in a way that makes those courses “realistically learnable”.

## How to Help

While putting up our own courses, we are also making a directory of existing open MIT course websites. This is because there's a mix of random links 3 layers deep in lmod,  very public CAT-SOOP cs classes, and OCW courses with various levels of completion. The best way to contribute is to add any course links you know or other open course material as a PR to [the courses/mit folder in this repo](https://github.com/mitsoul/mitsoul.github.io/tree/main/docs/courses/mit)! We will try to upstream them all to [mitsoul.org/courses](https://mitsoul.org/courses). We are avoiding OCW courses for now since we can easily add those later.

We also have a number of open source video tooling in [our GitHub organization](https://github.com/mitsoul), which we invite people to help improve and resolve issues on. We also have a much broader [set of focus areas](https://mitsoul.org/projects/) for projects that we want to support, so definitely reach out if you'd like to contribute to soul@mit.edu.
