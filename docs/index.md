title: Students for Open and Universal Learning
---

[SOUL](/name/) (students for open and universal learning) is an organization that works to accelerate, experiment with, and build a stronger culture of open education at institutions of higher education, starting with MIT.
We want to live in a world where anyone can learn anything from anywhere for free or at a low-cost.
To that end, our main goal in the short term is to open source learning materials from as many college courses as possible in a way that makes those courses "realistically learnable". To see the course materials we've curated so far, look at the [courses](/courses/) tab.

For a more detailed explanation of what we are doing and why, read our [manifesto](/manifesto/).
Note that while we collaborate closely with MIT [Open Learning](https://openlearning.mit.edu/), we are a separate entity from MIT [OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/). We currently operate as a student club at MIT.

If you are an educator and are open to putting your teaching materials online, we would love to help make the process very easy for you – email us and we can have a short call to get started.


<!-- Towards that [vision](/vision/), we are working on pushing the boundaries of what open education materials look like through various [projects](/projects/). -->

<!-- Anyone trying to innovate in the education space should be wary of overpromising and should acknowledge that the situation is probably more complicated than they realize. We are doing our best to be mindful of the [limits](https://failuretodisrupt.com/) of technology and of any single solution in disrupting education. Our approach involves systematic experimentation and, at every step, actually talking to and working with all kinds of students, teachers, administrators, and employers to make sure what we are building is sensible. -->

<!-- Our main goal for the 2023-2024 academic year is to
1. open source as many MIT classes as possible such that they are realistically learnable, with complete materials such as lecture videos, lecture notes, homework, homework solutions, Q/A, and more, and
2. do this while prioritizing quality over quantity, focusing on building solid infrastructure and workflows to scale up high-quality production in future semesters. -->

<!-- This website is under development. Check back at the end of January when we will have several courses on here, more information about each of our projects, and some sort of manifesto that provides a more formal analysis of our long-term vision. -->

If you want to get involved in any capacity or talk about anything, please email us at `soul@mit.edu` -- we'd love to talk to you!
