**Catalog description:**
\\
Vector spaces, systems of linear equations, bases, linear independence, matrices, determinants, eigenvalues, inner products, quadratic forms, and canonical forms of matrices. More emphasis on theory and proofs than in 18.06.

**From the math department's [subject overview](https://math.mit.edu/academics/undergrad/subjects/187x.html) for algebra and number theory:**
\\
18.700 is a rigorous treatment of linear algebra. Compared with 18.06, there is more emphasis on theory and proofs. Along with 18.100, this subject provides a good place to learn how to construct and write proofs.
