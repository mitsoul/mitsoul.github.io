**Catalog description:**
\\
A rapid introduction to the theoretical foundations of statistical methods that are useful in many applications. Covers a broad range of topics in a short amount of time with the goal of providing a rigorous and cohesive understanding of the modern statistical landscape. Mathematical language is used for intuition and basic derivations but not proofs. Main topics include: parametric estimation, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, Bayesian inference, and linear and logistic regression. Additional topics may include: causal inference, nonparametric estimation, and classification.
