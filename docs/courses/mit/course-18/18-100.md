**Catalog description:**
\\
Covers fundamentals of mathematical analysis: convergence of sequences and series, continuity, differentiability, Riemann integral, sequences and series of functions, uniformity, interchange of limit operations. Shows the utility of abstract concepts and teaches understanding and construction of proofs.
- 18.100A: Proofs and definitions are less abstract than in 18.100B. Gives applications where possible. Concerned primarily with the real line.
- 18.100B: More demanding than 18.100A, for students with more mathematical maturity. Places more emphasis on point-set topology and n-space.

Also see the math department's [subject overview](https://math.mit.edu/academics/undergrad/subjects/181x.html) for courses on analysis.
