**Catalog description:**
\\
A more extensive and theoretical treatment of the material in 6.1400J/18.400J, emphasizing computability and computational complexity theory. Regular and context-free languages. Decidable and undecidable problems, reducibility, recursive function theory. Time and space measures on computation, completeness, hierarchy theorems, inherently complex problems, oracles, probabilistic computation, and interactive proof systems.

Also see the math department's [subject overview](https://math.mit.edu/academics/undergrad/subjects/184x.html) for theoretical computer science.
