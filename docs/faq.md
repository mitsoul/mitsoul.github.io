<summary><b>Are you a non-profit?</b></summary>
SOUL currently operates under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_sponsorship">fiscal sponsorship</a> of The Hack Foundation (d.b.a. Hack Club), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit (EIN: 81-2908499). Fiscal sponsorship enables us to receive tax-deductible donations, and our fiscal sponsor provides us with administrative support. Note that "fiscal sponsorship" does not imply that our fiscal sponsor is giving us money. We'll probably get our own 501(c)(3) non-profit status at some point in the future.

<summary><b>How do you ensure the privacy of people in recorded videos?</b></summary>
We manually review each video recording, blurring faces and adjusting audio to ensure that no one is personally identifiable.

<summary><b>How do you get permission to use copyrighted materials?</b></summary>
We first try to obtain explicit permission to use a copyrighted work from the copyright holder. If that's not possible (e.g. if there is no contact information we can reasonably find), we use a thorough process to determine if <a href="https://copyright.gov/fair-use/">fair use</a> applies.
