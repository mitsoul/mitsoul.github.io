# License

Each course page and every piece of content we produce, referred to as "SOUL materials" (including PDFs, YouTube videos, etc.), will explicitly state the license under which it is shared. For content produced by others that we link to, you'll need to determine the licensing terms based on the information provided by the original creator.

## CC BY-NC-SA
If you see "Licensed under CC BY-NC-SA", it means that it is licensed under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

This means that you are free to:
- **Share** — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format
- **Adapt** — remix, transform, and build upon the material
<br>
The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license terms.

Under the following terms:

- **Attribution** — You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.
- **NonCommercial** — You may not use the material for commercial purposes.
- **ShareAlike** — If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.
<br>
No additional restrictions — You may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the license permits.

**Notices**:
- You do not have to comply with the license for elements of the material in the public domain or where your use is permitted by an applicable exception or limitation.
- No warranties are given. The license may not give you all of the permissions necessary for your intended use. For example, other rights such as publicity, privacy, or moral rights may limit how you use the material.

This is a human-readable summary of (and not a substitute for) the [license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode).

# Use of MIT Name
“MIT”, “Massachusetts Institute of Technology”, and its logos and seal are trademarks of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Except for purposes of attribution as required by our Creative Commons License, you may not use MIT’s names or logos, or any variations thereof, without prior written consent of MIT. You may not use the MIT name in any of its forms nor MIT seals or logos for promotional purposes, or in any way that deliberately or inadvertently claims, suggests, or in MIT’s sole judgment gives the appearance or impression of a relationship with or endorsement by MIT.

# MIT Interpretation of "Non-commercial"
Non-commercial use means that users may not sell, profit from, or commercialize SOUL materials or works derived from them. The guidelines below are intended to help users determine whether or not their use of SOUL materials would be permitted by MIT under the “non-commercial” restriction. Note that there are additional requirements (attribution and share alike) spelled out in our [license](/license/).
1. **Commercialization is prohobited**. Users may not directly sell or profit from SOUL materials or from works derived from SOUL materials. Example: A commercial education or training business may not offer courses based on SOUL materials if students pay a fee for those courses and the business intends to profit as a result.
2. **Determination of commercial vs. non-commercial purpose is based on the use, not the user.** Materials may be used by individuals, institutions, governments, corporations, or other business whether for-profit or non-profit so long as the use itself is not a commercialization of the materials or a use that is directly intended to generate sales or profit. Example: A corporation may use OCW materials for internal professional development and training purposes.
3. **Incidental charges to recover reasonable reproduction costs may be permitted.** Recovery of nominal actual costs for copying small amounts (under 1000 copies) of SOUL content on paper or CDs is allowed for educational purposes so long as there is no profit motive and so long as the intended use of the copies is in compliance with all license terms. Students must be informed that the materials are freely available on the SOUL website and that their purchase of copied materials is optional. Example: An institution in a remote area has limited Internet access and limited network infrastructure on campus, and a professor offers to create CDs of SOUL materials relevant to her course. The professor may recover the costs of creating the CDs.

If you have questions about acceptable use of SOUL materials, please contact us.

# Infringement Notification
SOUL, prior to making any SOUL materials publicly available, has reviewed all the material we produced to extensively to determine the correct ownership of the material and obtain the appropriate licenses to make the material available on SOUL. SOUL will promptly remove any material from our website that is determined to be infringing on the rights of others. If you believe that a portion of the material we produced or linked to infringes another’s copyright, contact us via email at `soul@mit.edu`. If you do not include an electronic signature with your claim, you may be asked to send or fax a follow-up copy with a signature. To file the notification, you must be either the copyright owner of the work or an individual authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner. Your notification must include:
1. Identification of the copyrighted work, or, in the case of multiple works at the same location, a representative list of such works at that site.
2. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity. You must include sufficient information, such as a specific URL or other specific identification, for us to locate the material.
3. Information for us to be able to contact the claimant (e.g., email address, phone number).
4. A statement that the claimant believes that the use of the material has not been authorized by the copyright owner or an authorized agent.
5. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate and that the claimant is, or is authorized to act on behalf of, the copyright owner.
