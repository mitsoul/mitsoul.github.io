## Background
When I was graduating from MIT, I felt a big sense of loss around losing access to all of MIT's courses. At MIT, you're allowed to take (with or without credit) any course and any number of courses, where taking a course gives you access to all of the course's learning materials. This opportunity inspires an amazing, empowering feeling that you can learn anything you want to, as long as you put in the required time and effort.

The main thing I got from the courses I took in college wasn't subject-specific knowledge, but learning how to learn. By the time I was graduating, I felt like as long as I had good enough learning resources, I could learn anything. And I felt like if I could learn anything, I could accomplish anything. I saw knowledge as the main bottleneck for myself to being able to do things, as I've been lucky to have enough of the other ingredients: opportunities, networks, funding, time, good health, etc.

I realized that I cared a lot about making learning resources accessible to everyone and that I had a lot of ideas for how MIT could put way more of its learning resources online. In my last semester of undergrad, I wrote up some ideas in a proposal and during the first year of my MEng, I worked part-time at MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW) to try some of them out. After that year, I left OCW and created SOUL with my friend Aayush Gupta.

## What we do
SOUL works to accelerate, experiment with, and build a stronger culture of open education at institutions of higher education, starting with MIT. We want to live in a world where it's possible to learn anything from anywhere for free or at low-cost. To that end, our main goal in the short term is to open source (e.g. via a Creative Commons license) learning materials from as many college courses as possible, in a way that makes those courses “realistically learnable.” By "realistically learnable," we mean that it's realistic for someone with a sufficient background (satisfying the course's prerequisites, with some leeway) to be able to actually teach themselves what the course is meant to teach.

To achieve this, for a given course, we try to put up as many materials from it as possible: lecture/recitation videos, lecture/recitation notes, homework, homework solutions, Q/A between students and course staff, etc – ideally everything the residential course had (and sometimes more: if the homework solutions are unclear, for example, we might improve them). At the moment, we are prioritizing quality over quantity, focusing on building solid infrastructure and workflows to scale up high-quality production in the future. We are also prioritizing which courses to put up first: we are prioritizing getting a full major's or minor's curriculum up, and we are also prioritizing experimenting with lab-heavy and discussion-heavy courses, which present their own unique challenges.

What is so exciting about this work is that it's a real, nontrivial challenge, but it is also so feasible. I want to emphasize: it is SO feasible. I can say confidently that, with not that much funding (e.g. much less than the funds required to support the OCW team for a single year), we could get hundreds of courses, all realistically learnable, online within a few years. As a concrete example, we are on track to get MIT's entire undergraduate economics curriculum, realistically learnable from, freely available online in one or two more years.

Before I go on, I'll mention that at MIT (and many other universities), the professors own their teaching materials. So, as long as they are willing to put their materials up, we are good to go. A valid concern is, why would the university itself be ok with all its course materials being freely available online? If that happened, why would anyone pay tuition to enroll in the university? Would the university change its policy for who owns course materials?

From the many professors and administrators I've talked to at MIT, I gather that MIT, at least, doesn't seem to be concerned about this. In fact, MIT seems to be trying hard to push open learning forward, as you might infer from its many open learning endeavors, from its open education resource (OER) endeavors like [OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/) to its certificate-granting [MicroMasters](https://micromasters.mit.edu/dedp/) programs. The real value of being at MIT comes from becoming friends with extraordinary people, access to research opportunities, close contact with world-class professors – things that won't be devalued by MIT's learning resources being freely accessible. Furthermore, enrolling as a tuition-paying student awards you a degree, which, at the moment, is arguably a necessary signaling mechanism in today's job market. It is likely that smaller, less-known universities would be threatened by this kind of thing and would not participate – and that's ok. We don't need every university to participate, just a few.

I'll describe briefly why what we are trying to achieve is so feasible.

The course publication pipeline, at a high level, involves three things: (1) recruiting professors (getting them to agree to put their teaching materials up), (2) collection (collecting and/or creating the course materials), and (3) processing (editing/subtitling class recordings and obtaining permission to use copyrighted external material).

For (1), after interviewing hundreds of professors, I can say confidently that most professors at MIT are willing to put their course materials up. For (2), in recent years, there has been a huge increase in the number of classrooms with auto-capture recording technology, so recording lectures is possible without too much logistical overhead. For (3), there are lots of technical innovations we have made (involving programming and a bit of AI), that make video editing, handling copyright, and other tasks very fast through automation. What I've mentioned is just a snippet of the many things that make scaling possible. For more detail see our [projects](/projects/).

## Vision

If the entire university-level curriculum was realistically learnable from freely available online resources, what would the world look like? Would this solve all the problems in higher education, including the cost of college in the United States forcing people to take on crippling debt? How would it empower people? Would it create more problems than it would solve?

Before I describe our vision, I want to say, vehemently, that we are not claiming that we will necessarily solve some huge world problem with what we are doing. We are wary of making grand assumptions, and we acknowledge that the situation is probably more complicated than we realize. Importantly, we are doing our best to be mindful of the [limits](https://failuretodisrupt.com/) of technology and of any single solution in disrupting education. Our approach involves systematic experimentation and, at every step, actually talking to and working with all kinds of students, teachers, administrators, and employers to make sure what we are building is sensible.

Whenever I pitch what we are doing to high-level administrators at places like MIT and Harvard, they tend to respond with something like: "Would this actually move the needle? We thought MOOCs would move the needle but they didn't. MOOCs failed."

I don't think MOOCs failed. It was naive to assume they would "solve" education: if you actually went and talked to the people that the leaders of the MOOC movement thought they would "save," this was clear. Now, we know that we should view MOOCs as an experiment. We learned many things: one of the highlighted insights was that the people who end up succeeding in MOOCs are those who already had a pretty good education and circumstances that endowed them with the ability to succeed in MOOCs. The problems in education are systemic. We should not expect any single endeavor to fix them.

I want to emphasize that we don't have to move the needle. We just have to make some difference and learn from it. There are countless [examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHdJLcmGR9E) of people who found open education materials life changing – are these cases alone not a good enough reason to work on improving OER? Furthermore, because what we are doing is pretty easy to do, compared to massive endeavors like EdX in terms of the time, funding, and manpower required, we might as well try it! I don't think we've made enough progress in open education materials to have properly tested what difference they could make. We haven't given them a chance. For example, OCW has a lot of courses, but most of them are outdated, most of them are not realistically learnable, and the course offerings represent some smattering of random courses – there's no sequence of complete courses equivalent to a major or minor from the undergraduate curriculum. And despite this, there's still so much [evidence](https://www.slideshare.net/stephenecarson/mit-opencourseware-case-study-slides) that OCW makes a big difference.

I do think that if we achieve our goal, we have the potential to move the needle through everything that we would make possible: resources that people could build on top of and around this large set of freely available high-quality learning material, such as in-person instantiations of open courses, tutoring services, and paid exams that offer credentials. In this way, open materials would be a necessary but not sufficient condition to moving the needle.

For example – during my time at MIT, I was a teaching assistant for 6.041, a probability class, for two semesters. I don't think I'm smart enough to have come up with the teaching materials for that class, but if I had the materials, I'm knowledgeable enough to teach the class well. If I had the access to the course materials, I could instantiate and teach the 6.041 probability class at my local community college, and this would provide the in-person interactions that so many people needed, that the 6.041 MOOC offered by MIT lacked.

Beyond in-person instantiations, tutoring and auto-graded feedback services could give people the help they need to self-learn the material. There's [huge potential for AI](https://ai.stanford.edu/blog/prototransformer/) to do a lot of this. We also see many individuals filling in this need, such as educators on YouTube that provide [walkthroughs](https://www.youtube.com/@Self-TaughtPhysicist) of OCW courses. And we know from David Joyner's [distributed classroom](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262547291/the-distributed-classroom/) that hiring large armies of TAs out of the student population in the previous semester's course offering can work extremely well.

There are just so many ways we could imagine the landscape of higher education changing. Open materials could encourage more flipped classroom designs and project-based learning. We might see [credentials becoming less important](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/28/opinion/jobs-college-degree-requirement.html), and more people demonstrating knowledge through portfolios. We might see lots of people contributing to the improvement of an open course.

Open sourcing the university-level curriculum has so much potential to do a lot of good. With the government also making a big [investment into OER](https://www.mass.edu/strategic/oer.asp), all signs point to now being the perfect time to innovate in this direction.

<!-- It's true that in today's world, you can learn a lot of things from the resources you can find on the internet: youtube videos, textbooks, open course materials, MOOCs, forums, blogs, Q/A sites, ... the list goes on. It's also true that one university's course offerings cover small percentage of the knowledge out there.

 But it can be difficult to learn from all of these because they aren't
 these materials are curated
 there's a reason university has you take this course instead of just throwing you out in the world
 its their opinion on the best way for you to learn that stuff -->
